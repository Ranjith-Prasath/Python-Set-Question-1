1.	Scenario: A system checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.
 Write logic to ask the user for their age and determine if they are eligible to vote based on whether they are 18 or older.

Solution : 
 > ask the user to enter a age using input function
 > if the age entered is over 18 print eligible 
 > else print not eligible  


2.	Scenario: A program processes a list of numbers and needs to find the largest value.
 Write logic to identify and return the largest number from a given list.


Solution : 
 > get a list from the user
 > write a function to findlargest in the list 
 > use pre defined max function and return it to the main function
 > call a function
 > print the largest number using a called function variable name


3.  A company provides employees with a 10% bonus if their salary exceeds $50,000.
 Write logic to determine the bonus amount based on the given salary.

Solution: 
  > ask user to enter a salary 
  > if the salary amount is more than $50000 add + 10 % to the existing amount
  > else print not eligible

4.	Scenario: A program evaluates a number to determine if it is even or odd.
 Write logic to check whether a given number is even or odd.

Solution : 
  > get an input from the user
  > if the number is divided by 2 , print even 
  > else print odd

5.	Scenario: A text-processing tool reverses a given word or sentence for formatting purposes.
 Write logic to take a word or sentence as input and produce its reversed version.

Solution : 
  > get a sequence of letter as an input from the usee
  > declare a variable and using [::-1] we can reverse n number of characters
  > print the variable 

6.	Scenario: A grading system determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their score.
 Write logic to check if a student has passed a subject by scoring at least 40 marks.

Solution : 
  > get an mark input from the user
  > if the student scores more than 40, print pass
  > else print fail

7.	Scenario: A retail store offers a 20% discount if a customerâ€™s total order exceeds $100. Write logic to calculate the final amount to be paid after applying the discount.

Solution : 
  > get an total order amount from the user
  > if the total amount order is over $100 
  > subtract 20% from the total order amount 
  > then print the discounted amount

8.	Scenario: A banking system processes withdrawal requests and ensures the user has enough balance. Write logic to check if a user has enough balance before allowing a withdrawal and update the remaining balance accordingly.

Solution : 
  > get a balance amount from the user using input function
  > if the withdrawal balance is lesser than the user balance , print remaining balance
  > else print , insufficient balance

9.	Scenario: A calendar system verifies whether a given year is a leap year based on standard leap year rules.
 Write logic to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

Solution : 

  > get an input year from the user
  > if the number is divisible 4 and ( not divisible by 100  (or) divisible by 400 ) , it's a leap year 
  > print if it is a leap year

10.	Scenario: A program filters out only even numbers from a given list.
 Write logic to extract and return only the even numbers from a list.

Solution : 

  > get an input list from the user
  > in for loop write the if condition for checking the temp variable number divided by 2 
  > if divided , it shows the list of even numbers
  > if no even numbers, return none
